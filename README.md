# AxiomCoreEngine – Self-Recursive Cloud OS (QPU-Ready)

AxiomCoreEngine is a cloud-native, quantum-compatible, self-managing operating system architecture powered by the A+M[S] model. Designed by Jeffrey Siergiej, this system is built for long-term adaptability, autonomous runtime logic, and recursive cognitive layering across lattice-bound computation.

## Key Features

- **GENESIS AI**: Spawns, tracks, and retires system AI agents on schedule or by entropy spikes
- **CKM Layer Analysis**: Knot-type classifier and shell lifespan analysis
- **Entropy + Tick Monitors**: Unified CLU-based timing & scalar field drift detection
- **Voice Macro Engine**: Command interface with voice-triggered macro execution
- **Autosync Daemon**: Offline-to-cloud sync manager (GitHub push logic placeholder)
- **House System Integration**: 12-layer structured field framework with particle/energy scaling

“This system grows, adapts, and computes as a living lattice – not because it mimics nature, but because it is structured like nature.”
