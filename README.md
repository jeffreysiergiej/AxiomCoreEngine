# AxiomCoreEngine

The **AxiomCoreEngine** is the foundation of a next-generation Scalar Intelligence Operating System (S.I.O.S.), built to unify personal, professional, and scientific tools into a dynamic, adaptive platform. It incorporates quantum field architecture, CKM structures (Collapse Knot Manifolds), and scalar lattice processing into a flexible, AI-driven OS.

## Features

- **CKM Engine** — Scalar field resonance analysis and memory encoding
- **QPU Dispatcher** — Compatible module for future Quantum Processing Units
- **RLQ Threader** — Reinforcement-Learning queue manager for macro-level autonomy
- **Voice Command Macros** — Supports user-defined voice-triggered tasks
- **Personalized UI Logic** — Custom macros and field overlays per user profile
- **Cloud-Local Hybrid** — Functions both as a lightweight local install and a cloud-based live OS
- **Adaptive Feedback Loop** — Continuously evolves to user behavior and environment
