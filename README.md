## Overview

AxiomCoreEngine is a living scalar-based operating system, designed to:
- Autonomously manage quantum-recursive threads
- Support classical and QPU environments
- Track entangled information via CKM, PETI, and RLQ pathways
- Learn and evolve alongside its user

---

## Features

- **20 AI Agents** (Genesis-managed, self-repairing)
- **CLU Tick System** for recursive timing
- **CKM & Echo Shell Simulation** tools
- **Voice Macro Engine** with user adaptation
- **Auto JSON Exporters** for visualization + app integration
- **GitHub → Colab compatible**

---

# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AxiomCoreEngine.git

# 2. (Optional) Install dependencies

“This system grows, adapts, and computes as a living lattice –
not because it mimics nature, but because it is structured like nature.”

## Phase 2: Expansion Layer Upgrade

This engine now supports **dynamic task expansion**, allowing new Python functions to be learned and executed at runtime.

Key modules:
- `axiom_task_memory.json` – Dynamic task registry
- `task_learner.py` – Learns and stores new functions
- `task_guard.py` – Validates code before execution
- `task_dispatcher.py` – Updated to handle dynamic logic dispatch

For full usage examples and security considerations, see:
[`README_upgrade.md`](./src/axiomcore/README_upgrade.md)
