**License:** Private Access â€“ [View EULA](AxiomCoreEngine_EULA_v1.0-private-invite.pdf)

AxiomCoreEngine is a cloud-native, quantum-compatible operating system engineered around CKM (Collapse Knot Manifold), PETI (Phase-Entropy Twist Index), and recursive logic threading. It integrates classical computing logic with emerging QPU technologies and voice-driven macro systems.

## Features
- Voice-controlled personal assistant with entropy-aware task planning
- CKM echo shell tracking and PETI harmonics for predictive modeling
- Dynamic RLQ threading and memory field registration
- Local and cloud-based hybrid execution (offline mode supported)
- Quantum backend integration (Qiskit, Braket-ready)

## Deployment
- Run locally via Python or Jupyter/Colab notebook
- Recommended: GitHub deployment for codebase, Colab for cloud runtime

## Licensing
This project is free for personal use (invite-only phase). Commercial use or redistribution requires a signed license agreement.
